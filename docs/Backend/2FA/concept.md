# Concept 

## Something you Know, Have and Are: 
Two factor authentication is based on the user providing two of the following three _'somethings'_:

1. Something you **Know** – the password or pin for an account
2. Something you **Have** – a physical device such as a mobile phone or a software application that can generate one-time passwords
3. Something you **Are** – a biologically unique feature to you such as your fingerprints, voice or retinas
