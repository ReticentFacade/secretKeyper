# Difference between `verifyOTP` & `validateOTP`

- Both verifyOTP and validateOTP serve the purpose of checking whether a given OTP token is valid or not, but they are used in different scenarios and contexts within a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system.
-----
## verifyOTP:
  * The verifyOTP functionality is typically used immediately after the user enters the OTP token they received (e.g., via email, SMS) during the login process. 
  * It's the first step of confirming the user's identity. This step ensures that the user has access to the device where the OTP was sent and that they can correctly enter the OTP.

## validateOTP:
  * The validateOTP functionality is used to reconfirm the user's identity for certain actions that require additional security measures beyond initial login.

  * For example, after logging in, the user might want to perform sensitive actions like changing their password, modifying account settings, or authorizing a transaction. 
  * In these cases, you might want to re-verify the user's identity by asking for an OTP token again. The validateOTP step ensures that the user is still in possession of their trusted device and can provide the OTP again.
-----
- The distinction between these two functionalities helps provide layered security. While both involve OTP verification, their use cases are different:

  * verifyOTP: Used during login or initial access to the system.
  * validateOTP: Used for additional security steps after the user is already logged in.

- By separating these functionalities, you can implement different levels of security for different actions within your application.
