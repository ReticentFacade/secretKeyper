You need to use **YOUR** `GPG_KEY_ID` (in this example it's: `E7E6DCCCA0FB20D85F0E3D67C093FFB8AD98F576`) to initiate `keyper` CLI:

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
