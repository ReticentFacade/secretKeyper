## Getting Started

#### Build the App

```
$ go build -o bin/keyper main.go
```

or

```
$ task build
```

#### Run the App

```
$ ./bin/keyper
```

or,

```
$ task run
```

#### Test the App

```
$ ./bin/keyper
For those of you who type more than talk, here's a Golang CLI-tool to keep your secrets safe!

  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  extract     Extracts your password from the website's folder

Use "keyper [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```


#### Add `bin` to Your PATH

To make it more convenient to run the 'keyper' binary from any location in your terminal, add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH, this way:

**For Zsh & Bash:**

1. Edit your `.zshrc`/`.bashrc` file using a text editor of your choice. You can use the `nano` editor, for example:

   ```sh
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```
   or, 
   ```sh
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add this at the end:
   ```
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/keyper/repo/bin
   ```
* Replace `/path/to/your/keyper/repo` with the actual path to your 'keyper' repository.

3. Reload your `zsh`/`bash` after saving:
```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```
or,
```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```
4. VOILA! You're ready to go! üòé
