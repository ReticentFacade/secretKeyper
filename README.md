#### Add `bin` to Your PATH

To make it more convenient to run the 'keyper' binary from any location in your terminal, add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH, this way:

**For Zsh & Bash:**

1. Edit your `.zshrc`/`.bashrc` file using a text editor of your choice. You can use the `nano` editor, for example:

   ```sh
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```
   or, 
   ```sh
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add this at the end:
   ```
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/keyper/repo/bin
   ```
* Replace `/path/to/your/keyper/repo` with the actual path to your 'keyper' repository.

3. Reload your `zsh`/`bash` after saving:
```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```
or,
```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```
4. VOILA! You're ready to go! 😎
