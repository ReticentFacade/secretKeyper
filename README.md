## Description:

SecretKeyper is an open source secure password store designed to keep your sensitive information safe while providing the convenience of easy access. With integrated 2FA, your stored data is doubly protected against unauthorized access.

Upcoming features shall assist developers in keeping `.env` secure. [I'm thinking something like this?](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*pJQUexTaSZN2HJMl.png)

  Available commands ---->
  - help
  - list
  - keyper
  - init
  - insert
  - extract
  - find
  - remove
  - update

```

## Current State 
- The API & CLI are ready to be used individually. 
- However, their integration is under development. Some important features (for developers) are yet to be implemented.

## Requirements: 
- [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/): Since Keyper-CLI uses GnuPG (or GPG) file protection under the hood, it's necessary that you install it.
    * [Check out this](./docs/Backend/keyper-cli/gpg.md) for an easy walk-through.
- Git

Use "keyper [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```


#### Add `bin` to Your PATH

To make it more convenient to run the 'keyper' binary from any location in your terminal, add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH, this way:

**For Zsh & Bash:**

1. Edit your `.zshrc`/`.bashrc` file using a text editor of your choice. You can use the `nano` editor, for example:

   ```sh
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```
   or, 
   ```sh
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add this at the end:
   ```
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/keyper/repo/bin
   ```
* Replace `/path/to/your/keyper/repo` with the actual path to your 'keyper' repository.

3. Reload your `zsh`/`bash` after saving:
```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```
or,
```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```
